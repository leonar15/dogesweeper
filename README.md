Completed todos:
* Add timer suport
* Add win/loss doge images
* Add game reset support for doge control
* Correctly display number of mines 
* Doge-ified win/loss messages
* Allow easy theming (create a new folder under /themes/my-theme/theme.css) then set the options.theme = 'my-custom-theme' when initializing the game.

How to create a theme:
* copy the folder /themes/doge into a new folder in the /themes directory
* name this new folder whatever you'd like (we'll use "my-theme" as the example)
* customize the theme.css file to change how things look
* to load a particular theme, just use a special link to set the "theme" option (e.g. /index.html#theme=my-theme)
